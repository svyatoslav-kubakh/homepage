Date: 2018-03-09 13-04
Slug: migrate-to-hugo
Summary: Finally I decided to migrate from WP to the Hugo engine.

Finally I decided to migrate from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to the [Hugo engine](https://gohugo.io/).

This is a simple and friendly system with clear [documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

If the result does not please in the future, I will always be able to migrate to [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/).
